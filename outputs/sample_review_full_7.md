## 1. Ensemble of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for real-time gravitational wave signal recognition
**Authors**: CunLiang Ma, Wei Wang, He Wang, Zhoujian Cao

**Summary**: X.-R. Li, W.-L. Yu, and G. J. Babu, Frontiers of physics 15, 1 (2020), and Y. Zhong and J. Cao, SCIENCE CHINA Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy 62, 1 (2019) . S. Sachdev, S. Caudill, H. Fong, R. K. Lo, C. Messick, K. Blackburn, P. Brady, et al.,

## 2. Moment based methods for ensemble assessment and calibration
**Authors**: Stephen Jewson

**Summary**: the results themselves show that the calibrated probabilistic forecasts contain useful predictability up to lead six . the results for the regression model are vs. climatology out of sample . however, the spread-regression model maintains its (albeit small) advantage .

## 3. Exploring Model Learning Heterogeneity for Boosting Ensemble Robustness
**Authors**: Yanzhao Wu, Ka-Ho Chow, Wenqi Wei, Ling Liu

**Summary**: tier-1 heterogeneous ensemble consensus method by weighted algorithms for combining bounding boxes and integrating classification confidence for each detected object . we introduce a connected component labeling (CCL) based alignment algorithm to align and convert the output of a semantic segmentation model .
